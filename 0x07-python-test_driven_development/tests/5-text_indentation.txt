How to Use text_indentation Function Doctests
============================================

This file demonstrates the usage of the `text_indentation()` function.

Printing Text with Newlines
===========================

The function `text_indentation()` adds two newlines after each '.', '?', or ':' character in the text.

>>> text_indentation = __import__('5-text_indentation').text_indentation
>>> text_indentation("Hello. This is a test. Does it work?")
Hello.
This is a test.
Does it work?

Handling Different Texts
========================

The function handles various texts containing '.', '?', and ':' characters in different contexts.

>>> text_indentation("Hello: how are you? Fine, thank you.")
Hello:
how are you?
Fine, thank you.

>>> text_indentation("One sentence. Another sentence. Final sentence.")
One sentence.
Another sentence.
Final sentence.

Invalid Inputs
==============

The function correctly handles invalid inputs by raising appropriate errors.

>>> text_indentation(123)
Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
TypeError: text must be a string

>>> text_indentation("This is a test sentence with consecutive  spaces.")
This is a test sentence with consecutive  spaces.
